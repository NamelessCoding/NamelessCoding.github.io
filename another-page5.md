## Failed sand simulator:

# **Implementation details**:

So it all began, when I had the simple idea of doing a sand simulator in shadertoy, nothing complicated of course, just a bunch of ifelse statements.
And I mean I've done this type of sand sim a couple of years ago, so I had some idea on how to execute it... However due to a bug, it wasn't acting like sand would,
on the other side however this bug was quite nice, so I decided to leave it there.

The sand started acting somewhat strange when I was implementing it and I wasn't sure why, however I decided to keep it and to introduce fractals into the mix!
This turned out better than I expected and as you can see, they generate quite interesting patterns as you see in these videos:
